                    This is the core or carry of the team. 
                    They should get the most gold, so the rest 
                    of the heroes needs to focus on protecting the 1. 
                    The heroes who are 1s have some sort of abilities 
                    that scale really well with time and items acquired 
                    in the game, so later on in the match they become 
                    really powerful (thus, "carrying" the game to victory). 
                    </p>
                </li>

                    This is the midlaner. Those heroes will almost always 
                    1 v 1 the other hero in the midlane, so they need to be 
                    effective at pressuring the other hero while securing last hits 
                    (killing the little minions to get gold). These heroes will 
                    level up faster since they won't share experience gains with another hero, 
                    thus, they will get more powerful faster.
                    They can quickly gank other lanes and set the tempo of the game.

                <li class="positions">POS 3
                    <p>
                    In the offlane, they are the heroes that get the last hits, 
                    so they get a gold advantage and pressure the enemy Position 1. 
                    These heroes most often are pretty tanky guys and gals. 
                    Think of them as a solid, durable hero who gets in the face 
                    of enemies and initiates the fight for a favorable outcome. 
                    They will often get Blink Dagger for mobility and some other 
                    items that make them survive a lot of damage.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li class="positions">POS 4
                    <p>
                    These heroes vary a lot, but they usually are able 
                    to deal a lot of damage and set up kills with stuns 
                    and disables. They can roam around the map some and 
                    assist in other lanes. They start out in the lane with the 3, 
                    the offlaner. They also buy support items.                   
                    </p>

                    This is a fully dedicated support that will most likely have the 
                    least gold in the game, because they don't spend time earning gold.
                    Their focus is assisting the teammates in fights by throwing out 
                    their spells, so they are most likely some kind of caster or 
                    healer-type hero. They direct a significant portion of their disposable 
                    income to support items like Wards and regenerative items or gear 
                    that can be used to protect other heroes.
