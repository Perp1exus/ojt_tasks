            <h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
                <p>When I'm not immersed in the world of Dota, 
                    you can often find me indulging in the art 
                    of web development as a hobby. It's a passion 
                    that allows me to explore my creativity and 
                    technical skills in equal measure. And while 
                    I navigate the complexities of coding and designing
                    , I also take pride in my achievements 
                    within the Dota 2 community, where I've 
                    earned the esteemed title of Legend 3.

                    Falcons roster was announced with two former Tundra Esports players 
                    - Skiter and Sneyking, as well as Malr1ne, ATF and Cr1t. The newly formed 
                    roster traveled to Jordan for a bootcamp before qualifying for
